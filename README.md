## Business Activities:

Coinbase is a crypto exchange company that is looking to making the selling and buying cryptocurrencies easier. With Coinbase after you open an account all that's left is for you to search the coin or asset you're trying to buy and hit buy it's that simply.
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The cool part about Coinbase is that there not a specific group of consumers that itâ€™s intended for. All the person needs to be is interested in crypto. They make the selling and buying process super easy so the process itself isn't hard all you need is knowledge of what you're buying or selling. The competition with these crypto exchange companies is who can make the exchange the fastest and the least amount of fees to an extent. Coinbase does a really nice job of making the process fast even though their fees can be high, especially as you use more money. The main and most powerful tool used by Coinbase is the Blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is pretty a ledger that records all the transactions that are happening inside of it. These transactions are completely decentralized so anyone can see the records of these transactions happening.


## Landscape:

Coinbase is in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies domain. Other major in companies in this domain are, Crypto.com, Binance, Robinhood, and Gemini. The business aspect is being able to trade as well as sell and buy cryptocurrencies. The company measures success based on its daily processing of transactions as well as how many new users it gains. Not a while ago binance used to the top player in this domain till Coinbase took over. This company is performing very well in relative to its competitors, with daily active users of 422,000 Coinbase leads the pack. Closely followed by Binance with 313,000 daily active users.

## Recommendations

If I would add anything to this company, it would be to offer more variety of coins that are tradable. Even though the companies has thousands of tokens available, they're still missing major coins specially gaming coins. The addition of gaming tokens would benefit the company because it would attractive a new group of users. Gaming tokens are very popular so adding that would expand their reach.
